# cpp-aux

Collection of 'useful' libraries/tools. To be used by other C++ projects.

The focus here is to use C++ modules. Which probably forces any consumers to use a recent compiler & build toolchain.

## aux

Would have liked to name the project 'aux' but this is a reserved filename on Windows...
